# Brief description
- Modern and Clean Layout: The use of minimalist design elements and clean lines provides a modern look that appeals to younger audiences. It avoids overwhelming the user with clutter, making navigation intuitive and easy.

- Emphasis on Visuals: The tarot card imagery is given prominence, which is important for an app focused on tarot readings. The use of vivid card illustrations and smooth transitions helps to engage users visually, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of Millennials and Gen Z.

- Interactive Features: The design includes interactive elements like "Shuffle the cards," "Draw Cards," and "Tap to get daily card," making the app engaging and aligning with the demographic's expectation for interactive, gamified experiences.

- Accessible Settings and History Management: The inclusion of settings for notifications and a history feature for past readings provides users with control over their experience and allows them to revisit their journey, which resonates with the self-care and reflective habits of the target audience.

# Define Success Criteria 

- **User Retention**: Success can be measured by how often users engage with the daily readings and return to the app. A goal could be a daily active user rate of 60% within 3 months of launch.
- **Public Good**: Helping users find comfort, reflection, or daily motivation through the app. Tracking the impact through user testimonials and social media shares.

# Design Aligns with Success Criteria

### User Retention
To measure success by user retention, the app needs to keep users coming back regularly. Design elements that support user retention include:

**Daily Engagement Features:**

> - **Daily Card Ritual:** The "Tap to get daily card" feature encourages users to log in every day for a new daily reading. This daily ritual can help establish a habit of using the app, which is essential for improving user retention.

> - **Push Notifications:** The settings menu includes notification preferences, allowing users to receive reminders for their daily card, tarot readings, or personalized messages. This can prompt users to re-engage with the app regularly.

### Public Good
To achieve the goal of providing Public Good by helping users find comfort, reflection, or daily motivation, the app should focus on delivering meaningful and supportive experiences:

**Reflection and Self-Discovery:**

> - **History and Reading Details**:** By saving readings and allowing users to review past interpretations, the app fosters self-reflection and growth. Users can see how their questions and insights evolve over time, promoting a sense of progress and personal development.
