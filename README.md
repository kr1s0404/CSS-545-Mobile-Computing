# üí° Motivation
I chose to develop this project exclusively for iOS to leverage the full potential of Apple's ecosystem. Using Swift, Apple's native programming language, ensures optimal performance and seamless integration with iOS features. Employing SwiftUI for the user interface allows for rapid development and iterative design, enabling me to build the app more precisely and efficiently.

For data management, I plan to utilize CloudKit, as it is a free and easy-to-use framework that provides robust cloud storage and synchronization capabilities within the Apple environment. Additionally, I am considering incorporating MapKit to introduce map-based functionalities that could enhance the application's user experience. As the project evolves, I may integrate additional frameworks and will update the documentation accordingly.
